## Welcome to the ***DUNGEON***
This is a little fun project I made to help me study for my Comp Sci 1050 class Final. 
The goal is to reach the end star at the bottom right. 
along your journey you will encounter **MONSTERS**. 
If you run into one you must fight it. 
Good Luck Traveler!!  

I use these commands to play:
- gcc DungeonMain.c Dungeon.c -o dungeon
- ./dungeon

If you want to exit, just input b instead of (w, a, s, d)
