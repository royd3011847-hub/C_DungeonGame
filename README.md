## Welcome to the ***DUNGEON***
This is a little fun project I made to help me study for my Comp Sci 1050 class Final. 
I ended up liking it a lot, so I countinued to work on it after the test. 

I use these commands to play:
- gcc DungeonMain.c Dungeon.c -o dungeon
- ./dungeon

## HOW TO PLAY ##
Your goal is to make it to the bottom right star on the map

use w a s d to traverse the map

if you get within 1 tile of a <span style = "color:red">Monster</span> (diagonals don't count) then you are forced to fight it

your score is kept by how much HP you have at the end

*** Good luck traveler! ***
