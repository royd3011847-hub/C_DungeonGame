## Welcome to the ***DUNGEON***
This is a project I made to help me study for my Comp Sci 1050 class Final.
I ended up liking it a lot, so I countinued to work on it after the test.  
The goal is to reach the end star at the bottom right. 
along your journey you will encounter **MONSTERS**. 
If you run into one you must fight it. 
Good Luck Traveler!!

I use these commands to play:
- gcc DungeonMain.c Dungeon.c -o dungeon
- ./dungeon

this project works on Windows and macOS
